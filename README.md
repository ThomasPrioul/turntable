This project consists in the design of an embedded system made of a RaspberryPi 2, an LCD touchscreen and an electronic board which will drive a step motor. The goal of this is to control a model-making railway turntable, and to integrate this system in a much bigger model-making system that already exists in Mr Charles's house. This existing system is based on the client-server model and already has server and client programs up and running.

The software embedded in the RaspberryPi will be made using Qt 5 (C++) and Qt Quick Controls 2.
